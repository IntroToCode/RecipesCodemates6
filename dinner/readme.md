# Spaghetti recipe

## Servings: 5 dishes

## Time to prepare: 10'

## Ingredients:

Spaghetti, olive oil, oregano, salt, tomato sauce, onion, garlic, hot peppers

## Equipment needed:

Pan, wooden spoon

## Steps for preparation:

1. Boil water and add the spaghetti & salt (no oil at this step please!)
2. Mix the tomatoe sauce with the fried onion and fried garlic
3. Remove the spaghetti from the water and mix it with the sauce
4. Add olive oil and oregano
5. Mince the hot peppers and sprinkle on spaghetti


### Notes: 
No oil with water!

Optional (but very important) wine pairing: Sangiovese for a medium-bodied red wine that is positively scrumptious with tomato sauce. For those who don't drink alcoholic libations...this spaghetti meal works well with a class non-flavored San Pellegrino sparkling water with 3 ice cubes :)
